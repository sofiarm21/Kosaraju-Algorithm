# Kosaraju-Algorithm
Kosaraju's algorithm is a linear time algorithm to find the strongly connected components.
In this project given a txt with a graph yhe program will tell you wich are the strongly connected components

## Installation

Clone or download the project 
Open it and in the 41 line write the path of the txt file
From command line navigate to the folder where the archive is and run:
```
  python kosaraju.py
```

## Graph file
For the program be able to read the txt file it should be structured this way:

* Type of graph
* Number of vertices (optional)
* verticeX,verctiveY

The project comes with an txt example file
